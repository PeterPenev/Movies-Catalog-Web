### Project Purpose
We are aiming to create a movie catalog with logging and rating system accessed from web.

### Technologies

1.   ASP.NET Core MVC 2.2
2.   Razor template engine for generating the UI
3.   MS SQL Server as database back-end, using Entity Framework Core to access database
4.   DataTables as a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library, with paging and sorting for a model entity
5.   Bootstrap for usable and responsive UI, with own web design and visual styles
6.   GitLab for source control management system, using master and development branches
7.   ASP.NET Identity System for managing users and roles, with 1 area for administrators and caching of genres
